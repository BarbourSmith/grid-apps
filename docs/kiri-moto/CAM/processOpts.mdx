# Process Options

The Process Options (on the left side of the screen) are a set of parameters which control the behavior of the CAM engine.

Process options can be saved in a profile, so they don't need to be reset each time a material is changed.
[Operation](./ops) defaults are stored in a profile as well, but are modified with that operation.

Each operation has parameters which can be hovered on to reveal their description.

## Tabs

<ImageCarousel base="/img/CAM/process/tabs" images="tabs" />

Tabs can be added with the plus button, finalized with the checkmark, and removed with the trash button.
their size is configurable.

## Stock

The stock defines the material that surrounds the part. as of V4.1, only rectangular stock is supported.
setting witdth, depth, and height to zero will make the stock the same size as the part's boundign box.

The stock size defaults to absolute size, but can be made to offset from the part's bounding box by setting the stock offset option to true. If the stock is smaller than the part, the part will not slice.

the "clip to" option will delete any toolpaths that go outside the stock.

using indexed stock is supported (barely). if you are using a rotary indexer, you can check the indexed option, and use [indexed operations](./ops#indexed-operations) to create operations on different faces of the part.

## Limits

The limits has options for setting the maximum feed rates, as well as the z-zero, and defaults for top and bottom offsets for operations.
Some operations have overrides for these values. 

## Output

The Output tab configures how lines generated by the CAM ops are processed before being exported.
these mainly effect what to do before and after each operation, and which way to traverse the toolpath (climb or conventional).

The **First Z Max** and **Force Z Max** are safety features that move to a safe Z
before the job and before pockets respectively. They are not checked by default for legacy compatibility.

## Origin

The origin tab controls the origin of the part, and allows configuration in the form of XYZ offsets.

## Expert

The expert tab controls advanced options for the CAM mode, which can speed up slicing, but may generate tool crashes.
use with caution.
