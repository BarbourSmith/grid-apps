# Operations

ops, not to be confused with [opps](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/opp-opps) are the operations applied to a model to remove material. The operations tab also contains meta operations that represent parts of the manufacturing process, but do not nessecarity generate toolpaths.

These operation include:

- Toolpath Operations
  - Global
    - [Outline](#outline)
    - [Level](#level)
    - [Rough](#rough)
    - [Contour](#contour)
  - Specific
    - [Drill](#drill)
    - [Trace](#trace)
    - [Pocket](#pocket)
- Other Operations
  - [Gcode](#gcode)
  - [Register](#register)
- Laser Operations
  - [laser on](#laser-on)
  - [laser off](#laser-off) 
- Indexed Operations
  - [Index](#index)
  - [lathe](#lathe)


## Global Operations

Operations that apply to all objects in the workspace. 

### Outline

<ImageCarousel base="/img/CAM/example/outline/" images="outline" />


The Outline op generates a toolpath surrounding the edges of a part. It is highly configurable and can select both internal or external edges specifically. The Outline operation is great for:

- Cutting out many objects at once
- Generating a rough/finishing pass on an object
- Easily avoiding spefic features like pockets or holes


### Level

<ImageCarousel base="/img/CAM/example/level/" images="level" />

The Level op creates a flat-surface clearing toolpath across a selected area. It is designed to remove material to a consistent depth, making it useful for preparing stock, flattening uneven surfaces, or cleaning up residual material. The Level operation is great for:

- Surfacing raw stock before detail cuts
- Creating uniform faces on complex objects
- Clearing large areas with consistent depth quickly


### Rough

<ImageCarousel base="/img/CAM/example/rough/" images="rough" />

The Rough op removes large volumes of material quickly using a stepped-down toolpath. It is typically the first pass in a multi-step workflow, clearing space for finishing tools without concern for fine detail. The Rough operation is great for:

- Rapid bulk material removal
- Preparing many parts for finishing simeltaneously.
- Clearing voids or flat faces for many objects at once
- Preparing a part for finish machining
- Preserving tool life by reducing cutting load in later passes

### Contour

<ImageCarousel base="/img/CAM/example/contour/" images="contour" />

The Contour op generates detailed toolpaths for complex organic surface geometries. It can trace along the x or y axis and has configurable precision. It is useful for:

- Carving 3D shapes with organic or curved profiles
- Finishing complex wall geometries
- cleaning up a part after [roughing](#rough)
